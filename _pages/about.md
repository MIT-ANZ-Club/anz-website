## About Us
The MIT Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Club aims to foster connections between Australian and New Zealand students at MIT, while hosting events for the wider MIT community interested in Australian and New Zealander culture.

The ANZ Club has been around at MIT since the early 2000s, but was recently rebooted in 2022 after over 15 years of inactivity. You can check out the [old website here](https://web.mit.edu/anz/www/archive/home.html).
